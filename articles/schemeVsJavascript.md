# Scheme vs. Javascript

### What Could Have Been...

I remember reading that when Brendan Eich was first asked to develop a scripting language for the browser, he was told it would be like "Scheme in the browser".

Deadline pressures (he had only two weeks) and pressure to make the language more recognizable worked against these lofty goals.

So now the language looks like Java, is called Javascript for absolutely no good reason, and has more than a few bizarre, confusing, billion-dollar mistakes.

Node.js even made continuation passing style popular, something scheme couldn't manage because it had *too many parenthesis*. It really is all about the curly braces.

All the things that people say they like about Javascript, it got from Scheme. Everything people hate about Javascript, didn't come from Scheme.

Should have just made it Scheme.
