<h1>Scheme vs. Javascript</h1>

<h3>What Could Have Been...</h3>

<p>I remember reading that when Brendan Eich was first asked to develop a scripting language for the browser, he was told it would be like "Scheme in the browser".</p>

<p>Deadline pressures (he had only two weeks) and pressure to make the language more recognizable worked against these lofty goals.</p>

<p>So now the language looks like Java, is called Javascript for absolutely no good reason, and has more than a few bizarre, confusing, billion-dollar mistakes.</p>

<p>Node.js even made continuation passing style popular, something scheme couldn't manage because it had *too many parenthesis*. It really is all about the curly braces.</p>

<p>All the things that people say they like about Javascript, it got from Scheme. Everything people hate about Javascript, didn't come from Scheme.</p>

<p>Should have just made it Scheme.</p>
