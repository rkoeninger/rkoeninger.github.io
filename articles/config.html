<h1>Configuration</h1>

<h2>Stop It</h2>

<h3>Common Understanding</h3>

<em>But what if we need to change something?</em>

<p>This question haunts our minds. If you hardcode a value into your program, like a timeout duration, for instance, and you need to change it, what do you do? Edit the code, rebuild, and redeploy? Are you crazy?</p>

<p>So you put the timeout value in a separate file and have the program read from that file on startup. Or even refresh the in-memory value when the program detects the separate file has changed.</p>

<p>Now values that control the details of the program's behavior can be controlled convienently and safely.</p>

<p>The world of the program has been split into a dichotomy: "code" and "configuration".</p>

<p>Code is compilied into an immutable executable ahead of time. It is environment (Dev machine, QA, Staging, Production) agnostic. Don't put anything here thay you might need to change post-deployment.</p>

<p>Configuration is paired with a copy of the compiled code upon deploy and can be modified with a simple text editor. It is environment specific. Anything that you might need to change post-deployment is put here.</p>

<h3>Socrates Lives</h3>

<em>What do people do when they want to be able to configure which behavior to use?</em>

<p>From what I've seen, they write a few, different implementations of possible, desired behaviors and then put a setting in the config where one of them can be specified: A, B or C.</p>

<em>But what if we need an option other than A, B or C?</em>

<p>Then you add one in the code...</p>

<em>So I still have to edit the code, making this approach to config pointless?</em>

<p>Oh... I guess it does...</p>

<em>Or what if some of those config values need to depend on each other or we want to put a function in the config? So I have setting A and setting B and setting B needs to be A + 1 or something to that effect...</em>

<p>Well, then you put <c>A</c> in the config and declare <c>B</c> in the code and make <c>B = lookup("A") + 1.</c></p>

<em>But I want B to be part of the config so I can change it's relationship to A.</em>

<p>Well, then declare both of them in the config and make B one more than whatever you make A.</p>

<em>But that defeats the purpose of the config. I want the relationship between A and B to be explicit, I want to not repeat myself and I want be able to modify all of these things.</em>

<p>That sounds more like non-AOT code.</p>

<em>So this non-AOT code thing can do what I need...</em>

<h3>A Different Take On it</h3>

<p>Basically, the lesson is that depending on how far you want to take configuration, you might need to use a full programming language for your config files.</p>

<p>You might even need to compile the whole application on startup.</p>

<p>Have fun with that.</p>

<p>Should probably edit this some more.</p>

<h3>C# Example</h3>

<p>Drop something like this into your application to use a "config file" like the one described above:</p>

<csharp>
// Declares the properties in the config file.
public interface IConfig
{
    String Greeting { get; }

    int RetryCount { get; }

    DateTime Cutoff { get; }

    String FormatName(String name);
}

// Compiles and loads the config file implementation
// and makes it available to the application.
public static class App
{
    private static readonly CsConfigLoader<IConfig> loader =
        new CsConfigLoader<IConfig>(
            ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["CsConfigPath"].ToString());
    public static void LoadConfig() { loader.Get(); }
    public static IConfig Config { get { return loader.Get(); } }
}

// Call LoadConfig() instead of waiting for first usage
// to lazily compile/load.
// Loading up front prevents compile errors from happening
// at some unknown point in the future.
public static class Program
{
    public static void Main(String[] args)
    {
        App.LoadConfig();
        Console.WriteLine("Brand name: " + App.Config.Greeting);
    }
}
</csharp>
