# Dumbing Down versus Plain Speaking

There's a negative stigma with trying to make techincal subjects more accessible. Such attempts are often derided as "dumbing-down".

Sometimes, that's exactly what happens. Sometimes, pertinent details are left out to make the instructor's life easier, to the detriment of the student. The material has truly been dumbed-down because it has been made less useful.

A better approach would be "plain speaking". Plain speaking consists of simplifying the details of communication without leaving anything out. Plain speaking is about making a subject accessible. Plaing speaking is inclusive and useful. Dumbing-down is inclusive, but not useful.

In ES6, Arrow Functions were introduced. Notice they are not called "Lambda Expressions", as they are in many other languages. This naming choice is a win for accessiblity. The phrase "Lambda Expression" doesn't do much to give away what it means.

The value of communication is in what's being communicated and that it is communicated successfully, not that it is communicated exclusively.
