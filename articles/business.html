<h3>Technical / Business Gap</h3>

<p>Another gap is the one between business and IT. I've noticed that often the business or customer has a need that they don't even think to ask for because they think it's too difficult to implement or they don't realize it's possible. In reality, that need may be trivial to provide.</p>

<p>I remember working on an application that involved organizing effort among many residental and commerical addresses. Each location would receive a post card notifying them that a worker would arrive on a particular date in a given time window to perform the work.</p>

<p>In order to check if the post card had been sent to a partiular address, someone from the business unit would have to search for the address on the master job site screen, and then drill through 3 or 4 pages/dialogs to see if the post card had been sent.</p>

<p>A request came in to show if a post card had been sent on the master job site screen next to each address one had been sent to. This took me only a few minutes to implement. Adding this really made the manager's day. It probably saved him hours of time over the course of using the application and it only took a few minutes to make the customer happy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this sometimes works the other way. Customers demand that something be implemented and don't understand how it could be so difficult. It might not be possible to explain if the problem arises in the application's fundamental design or architecture in some way.</p>

<p>Changes are easier to make the less they defy the fundamental assumptions the application was built on.</p>
