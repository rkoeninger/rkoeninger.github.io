The HTML is too verbose.

Markdown, AsciiDoc don't support enough of the HTML contructs.

Polymer is confusing and might not allow me to do what I want with templates. Plus, custom tags have to have hyphens in the name, so names can't be short.

The ClojureScript route has the problem of having to escape strings and break up strings to insert inline tags. Hard to author content like this.

XML requires entities to be escaped and preformatted text to be wrapped in [CDATA[]].

Can JSX do custom tags?

Can I parse HTML-style with non-standard tags? Yes.

Full circle: I'm writing HTML again.
