## With Style

### Impossible is Hard

Cache invalidation, naming things, natural language processing, autocorrect... they all have something in common. They are not just difficult to do correctly, they are impossible to do correctly, strictly speaking.

### Computers Are Not Humans

Things that seem simple for humans to do, like parse an English sentence, are notoriously difficult for computers to do.

Humans and computers learn and are taught differently. Computers are programmed. Facts and algorithms are inserted directly into their memory. Humans learn by example, slowly building a set of statistical hueristics.

Humans also spend years developing their statisical language analysis abilities before they are even considered fluent and many years more before they are considered eloquent. How many years has the most educated computer been learning natural language?

*TODO look for reference*

### Humans Can't English Too Good, Neither



### They Want The Impossible

People have developed the expectation that technology do the impossible.
