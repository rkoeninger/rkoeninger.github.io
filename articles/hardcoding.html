<h1>Hardcoding? What Does It Really Mean?</h1>

<h2>Learning is facilitated by oversimplifications, but mastery is impeded by them</h2>

<h3>Programming 101</h3>

<q>Remember, these are all lies. Everything I tell you is a lie.</q>

<p>A good professor of mine would tell us this regularly. He wanted us to understand that no principle is absolute and that it's important to understand why something is a principle so that one does not fall into a cargo cult mindset.</p>

<p>Imagine you were teaching a fresh, young mind their first programming lesson. They do not yet have any concept of functions, conditional branches, loops, types or even variables. If you sit them in front of an editor showing a starting point for learning programming in Java:</p>

<java>
class Program {
    static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
</java>

<p>A series of questions would follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is "class"?</li>
  <li>What is "static"?</li>
  <li>What is "void"?</li>
  <li>What is "String"?</li>
  <li>What is "args"?</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>You'd probably just tell the student to ignore those things for now and write (verbatim): <c>System.out.println("Hello, World!");</c> and hit run.</p>

<p>I recall it took a long time for my classmates and I to understand what <c>static</c> was. It would keep showing up in compile errors: <c>cannot reference non-static method in a static context</c>. So, for a while, we just ignored the concept and marked everything <c>static</c>.</p>

<h3>Lies Make For Early Guides</h3>

<h3>Unlearning It All</h3>

<p>You spend your school years learning all these mostly-true things, and then your working career discovering how they're wrong.</p>
