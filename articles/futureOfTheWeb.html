<h1>Future of the Web</h1>

<h3>Language</h3>

<pre>
hydra/hype/jazz: a single language for the web
	s-expr syntax, of course
	prefer minimalism and small platform size over features
	needs html-id namespaces
	html/js property names need to be the same
		camelCase/lisp-case/wHaT_3veR
	needs module system
		you could have something like requirejs/amd for styling and fonts
	need to be able to pass args into javascript modules,
		not just return html with links to js files
	unified syntax
		with customizable dom-building functions
		and style-manipulation/application functions
	needs element selector syntax that is basically a predicate in the same language
		so instead of `"#id"`
		it would be `(comp (= "id") get-id)` or `(with-id "id")`
	interaction with DOM is functional-reactive like in react.js or om.cljs
	uses customized jquery to limit implementation size
	can interpret zen syntax on the fly
	need to be able to avoid Flash-of-unformatted-text
	keep minimization in mind
	bundling content(html)/behavior(js)/styling(css) into a single package
	support compiled and interpreted modes
		compiled with a debug symbols file that can be fetched when error is encountered
