<h3>Knowing a Little Bit of Haskell Might Help</h3>

<haskell>
class CovariantFunctor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

class ContravariantFunctor f where
    contramap :: (b -> a) -> f a -> f b

class InvariantFunctor f where
    xmap :: (a -> b, b -> a) -> f a -> f b
</haskell>

<p>The type signature for <c>fmap</c> can be read as "If <c>a</c> implies <c>b</c>, then that implies that <c>f a</c> implies <c>f b</c>". In more OO-terms, "If <c>A</c> is a subtype of <c>B</c>, then <c>F&lt;A&gt;</c> is a subtype of <c>F&lt;B&gt;</c>". This is the same as saying that <c>f</c> is covariant.</p>

<p>The type signature for <c>contramap</c> can be read as "If <c>b</c> implies <c>a</c>, then that implies that <c>f a</c> implies <c>f b</c>" or "If <c>B</c> is a subtype of <c>A</c>, then <c>F&lt;A&gt;</c> is a subtype of <c>F&lt;B&gt;</c>. Notice that the <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> are reversed in the first part of the statement. This is the same as saything that <c>f</c> is contravariant.</p>

<haskell>
class BivariantFunctor f where
    bimap :: Either (a -> b) (b -> a) -> f a -> f b
</haskell>

<p>Functions with a fixed input type are a well-known CovariantFunctor. Functions with a fixed output type are a well-known ContravariantFunctor. There don't seem to be many InvariantFunctors. But what counts as a BivariantFunctor? Identity?</p>

<haskell>
instance BivariantFunctor Identity where
    bimap _ ix = ix
</haskell>

<p>Does it even work for Maybe?</p>

<haskell>
instance BivariantFunctor Maybe where
    bimap _ Nothing = Nothing
    bimap (Left f) (Just x) = Just (f x)
    bimap (Right g) (Just x) = error "Maybe isn't contravariant"
</haskell>

<p>Looks like an invariant functor has to be <strong>both</strong> covariant and contravariant at the same time. The only type that is both broader and smaller than <c>a</c> is <c>a</c> itself, thus it's refered to as invariant.</p>

<p>A bivariant functor would then be <strong>either</strong> covariant or contravariant. But that introduces non-determinism and doesn't fit into the type system.</p>

<h3>Now I'm Just Goofing Around</h3>

<p>Is there such a thing as a Contravariant Applicative Functor?</p>

<haskell>
class ContravariantApplicativeFunctor f where
    ap :: f (b -> a) -> f a -> f b

instance ContravariantApplicativeFunctor (-> r) where
    ap Nothing _ = Nothing
    ap _ Nothing = Nothing
    ap (Just f) (Just g) = g . f
</haskell>

<p>Apparently, a fixed-output-type function is one.</p>

<p>And is there such a thing as an Applicative Monad?</p>

<haskell>
class ApplicativeMonad m where
    apm :: m (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b

instance ApplicativeMonad Maybe where
    apm Nothing _ = Nothing
    apm _ Nothing = Nothing
    apm (Just f) (Just x) = f x
</haskell>
