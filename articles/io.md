# Functional and Object-Oriented approaches to I/O

## There are a few right ways to solve a problem, and a million wrong ways

### Holy False Dichotomy, Batman!

> Object-oriented programming makes programs comprehensible by isolating and encapsulating moving parts.

> Functional programming makes programs comprehensible by minimizing moving parts.

> Haskell puts moving parts completely outside the language proper.

### The IO Monad

Represents an IO action to be run at some point later. The whole program becomes one giant IO action.

### IO by Dependency Injection

Not mutually exclusive with the functional IO.
