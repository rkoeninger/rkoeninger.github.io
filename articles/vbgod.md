# I Am a VB God!

## Apparently...

### Background

While setting up [my Elance profile][1] a while ago, I took a couple of the skills tests to see if I could get myself to stand out. I did pretty well on the standard Java and Scala tests (top 5% each) and since I was flying high, I tried the VB.Net test.

I thought I did alright...

Just alright...

And the results...

Top 5%.

I have never used VB.Net in a project. I have never read more than a few dozen lines of VB.Net.

### VB?! Ew, Gross!

Yes, it looks weird to me, too. But I've long been broken of the curly-brace fixation.

Looking at a feature comparison, VB.Net has quite a lot to offer. It's not that different from C#, as they were designed to be the two original flagship languages of the .Net Framework.

If you look past the syntax, the two languages have as much in common as C# and Java, and those two can be hard to distinguish even visually.

### VB Toolbox

*TODO cool stuff in VB.net*

### VB History

The undesirable parts of VB classic seem to have the same pathology as JavaScript. They both started out as simple "scripting languages" that would only be used to link UI components to business logic or libraries (COM Components) where the real work would be done.

Over time, people started to use it for *real work* and things got out of hand.

There's a lesson to be learned here: stop designing intentionally crappy languages. In trying to make them more intuitive for people who don't know what they're doing, we got a language where no one knows what's going on.
