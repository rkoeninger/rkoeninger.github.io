<h1>Names and Types</h1>

<h2>More Closely Related Than You Think</h2>

<p>I have this idea that when you name a piece of data, you also give it a type. Whether you're using a language with or without a type system.</p>

<p>Consider a simple type like this:</p>

<java>
class Person {
    String givenName;
    String emailAddress;
}
</java>

<p><c>givenName</c> and <c>email</c> aren't just any strings. They are two different things that are rarely interchangeable. There may be no complete, formal way of verifying whether a particular character sequence is a valid given name. Even verifying emails isn't easy. But what would you think of code that did this: <c>p.emailAddress = p.givenName;</c>? You wouldn't write <c>p.emailAddress = p.birthDate</c>. Why would you write <c>p.emailAddress = p.givenName</c>.</p>

<p>And that code would pass the type-checker. But the type-checker is supposed to prevent type errors. I'm thinking it should also be a type error to assign a given name to an email address, just as it would be a type error to assign a birth date to a street address.</p>

<p>This can be done, even in Java. But it's not easy.</p>

<java>
abstract class NewType<T> {
    T value;
    NewType(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}

class GivenName extends NewType<String> {
    GivenName(String name) {
        super(name);
    }
}

class EmailAddress extends NewType<String> {
    EmailAddress(String email) {
        super(email);
    }
}

class Person {
    GivenName givenName;
    EmailAddress emailAddress;
}
</java>

<p>Now code like <c>p.emailAddress = p.givenName;</c> will cause the appropriate type error.</p>

<pre>
error: incompatible types: GivenName cannot be converted to EmailAddress
        p.emailAddress = p.givenName;
                          ^
1 error
</pre>

<p>Type-checking isn't the whole point, though. I've always thought that type-checking was only a part of the potential benefits of a type system. If names-as-types is going to have any practical benefit, it would have to enable more effective code completion.</p>

<h3>Name as Subtype</h3>

<p>When you're reading code and you see something like <c>int customerId</c>, that value is not just any <c>int</c>, it's a <c>customerId</c>. <c>customerId</c> is a specific case of an <c>int</c>. Further than that, that fact that a customerId is an int is an implementation detail. It happens to be the case that customerId is currently an int, but that could change. And if the codebase has <c>int customerId</c> spread throughout it, it would be really hard to change customerIds to be a Guid instead.</p>
