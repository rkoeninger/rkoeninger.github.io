# Hardcoding? What Does It Really Mean?

## Teaching beginners is facilitated by misleading oversimplifications, but mastery is impeded by them

### Programming 101

Imagine you were teaching a fresh, young mind their first programming lesson. They do not yet have any concept of functions, conditional branches, loops, types or even variables. If you sit them in front of an editor showing a starting point for learning programming in Java:

```java
class Program {
    static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
```

A series of questions would follow:

  * What is "class"?
  * What is "static"?
  * What is "void"?
  * What is "String"?
  * What is "args"?

And so on.

You'd probably just tell the student to ignore those things for now and write (verbatim): `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` and hit run.

I recall it took a long time for my classmates and I to understand what `static` was. It would keep showing up in compile errors: `cannot reference non-static method in a static context`. So, for a while, we just ignored the concept and marked everything `static`.
