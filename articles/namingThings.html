<h1>Naming Things</h1>

<p>I found a <a href="//www.fantom.org/forum/topic/1489">list of words</a> compiled by Brian Frank, one of the creators of <a href="//www.fantom.org/">the Fantom language</a>, that can used to help pick names for classes and other concepts in code.</p>

I've tried to divide the list into sections of related meaning. This page can serve as a programmer's thesaurus.

<h3>By Purpose</h3>

<h4>Coordination/Discovery</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Directory</li>
  <li>Registry</li>
  <li>Locator</li>
  <li>Compass</li>
  <li>Path[way]</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cache</li>
  <li>Bank</li>
  <li>Repository</li>
  <li>Depot (write-mainly)</li>
</ul>

### Bad Ideas

#### Greek Alphabet (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, ...)

I don't think these are a great idea because they imply a fixed number of something or a fixed structure. Having a fixed number is a violation of the [0/1/N Rule][01n-rule] and having fixed structure [precludes general composition][scale-arch].

#### Naming things after the pattern

Flyweight, Decorator, Visitor, Factory, DAO - may be a good idea so people are more likely to know what they are. may be a bad idea if you have two related things named with that pattern e.g. ___VisitorVisitor.

#### Requiring User to Become Familiar with Obscure Subject Matter

Concepts imported from Category Theory are referred to by their original names, which don't make nearly as much sense in the context of programming.

different, weird names for things that aren't that different

```haskell
(a -> b)   -> k a -> k b    -- Functor
(a -> k b) -> k a -> k b    -- Monad
k (a -> b) -> k a -> k b    -- Applicative Functor
```

Maybe these could just be called `Convertable`, `Chainable` and... I don't about the last one.

#### Generic Words

Field, Property, Function - avoid terms already used in language

Helper

Handler

Config

Context

____Base

I____

____-let

Info

Map - already overloaded for hashtables and map::a->b->fa->fb

Abstraction

Utils - instead of creating a single Utils class, create mutliple classes named after what they do.

Res (latin obj) - basically means "Thing"

Thing[y|ie] - I will end you; You will be righteously decapitated by the nearest sane person; DO NOT DO IT!
