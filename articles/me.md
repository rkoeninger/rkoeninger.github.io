### Places I've Worked

**Software Consultant**<br />**October 2014 - Present**

Robert worked on an agile team that developed multiple internal and external web applications for our financial services client. He implemented complex loan amortization calculations involving several independent factors. He implemented thorough test suites to avoid regressions while keeping the code well-factored and consistent. He helped develop the front end, which served client employees and public customers. Some tools used to develop the front end include Bootstrap, LESS and JQuery.

He introduced improved testing practices including JavaScript unit tests with Jasmine and using user scripts via the TamperMonkey plugin for Chrome to automate parts of interactive testing. Improved testing resulted in the discovery of bugs and style inconsistencies. He was part of an effort to synchronize data between the aforementioned applications and Microsoft Dynamics CRM using RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.

### Stuff I Know

#### Environments

<img src="/logos/eclipse_icon.svg" class="inset-left" />
Like Java, Eclipse was the first IDE I used for any length of time. Also like Java, I started to appreciate it less once offered an alternative. I used it for both Java and Scala.

<img src="/logos/vs.svg" class="inset-left" />
Visual Studio has been my main IDE these past few years as most of my work has been in the .Net space. I tend to use it in concert with ReSharper from JetBrains.

#### Languages

<img src="/logos/csharp.svg" class="inset-left" />
Another consequence of working in .Net for a while is that C# has become my main working language. I was resistant to some of the details at first coming from Java, but I have come to prefer it.

<img src="/logos/vbnet.svg" class="inset-left" />
I didn't think I knew much about VB until I was told that [I am a VB god](/index.html?articleId=vbgod.md). I'm not sure I'd want to work in it, but I could manage. Don't even ask about VB Classic.

<img src="/logos/java.svg" class="inset-left" />
Java was the first language I really got into. I started learning when it was on version 1.4.2 back in high school. Even though I haven't been using for work as recently, I've kept up on developments in the language, up through the introduction of lambdas in Java 8 and the proposed module system for Java 9+.

<img src="/logos/clojure.svg" class="inset-left" />
In my search to find new and better ways to work, I heard about Lisp-family languages like Scheme/Racket and ANSI CommonLisp. Despite my interest, I couldn't find a way to bridge the gap between my existing skills and these very foreign languages. Clojure gave me the opportunity to re-use my existing Java skills while also expanding into new worlds of programming.

<img src="/logos/scala.svg" class="inset-left" />
Scala is for Java coders who want a language that is more suitable for functional programming and object-oriented programming.

<img src="/logos/fsharp.svg" class="inset-left" />
If Scala is for Java coders who want to use Haskell, then F# is for C# coders who want to use O'Caml? I don't know, but similar to Scala, F# manages to excel the leading language on its platform in almost every way (except for usability in the debugger).

<img src="/logos/haskell.svg" class="inset-left" />
I went to learn Haskell after dabbling with Scala for a crash course in pure functional programming. I haven't written much code in Haskell, and maybe I never will, but the experience has been valuable nonetheless.

#### Source Control

<img src="/logos/git.svg" class="inset-left" />
In more than one circumstance, I have been the unoffical "Git Master" on a team. The first time, it was because I was the only one who knew how to `git clone`. The second was because I was the only one who had heard of `git rebase`.

<img src="/logos/svn.svg" class="inset-left" />
It has been a couple of years since I used Subversion, but I don't remember minding it much. I recall teams I worked on almost never branched because of the difficulty in doing so. Instead, we would do "code freezes" where no one was allowed to check in code until a release was finished. I'm sure there was a better way.

#### Web / Browser

<img src="/logos/html.svg" class="inset-left" />
<img src="/logos/css.svg" class="inset-left" />
<img src="/logos/javascript.svg" class="inset-left" />
The trifecta of web goodiness. I haven't gone out of my way to learn the ins and outs of these. Instead, I just pick up parts of them as I go along, and as the various browsers slowly implement parts of them.

<img src="/logos/jquery_icon.svg" class="inset-left" />
I have been using JQuery for a while. My experience is mostly with version 1.x, so there will be new functionality I'm not familiar with.

<img src="/logos/jasmine.svg" class="inset-left" />
I used Jasmine to test this very site. Check out [the spec runner page](/spec.html). I like how easy it was to get up and running. It took a bit longer to get it to work with Require.js, but it went better than one would expect from a handful independently developed open source projects.

<img src="/logos/requirejs_icon.svg" class="inset-left" />
The only project I've used Require.js in is this site. I had to mess around with multiple configurations - one for the `main` module and one for the Jasmine spec runner page - as well as shims for some libraries.

<img src="/logos/nodejs.svg" class="inset-left" />
<img src="/logos/npm.svg" class="inset-left" />
Used on a couple of projects. Ease of getting started is great, but I don't have any advanced experience with these.

#### Project Management

<img src="/logos/jira_icon.svg" class="inset-left" />
Two former workplaces of mine used Jira. I'm familiar with it, but it feels kind of heavyweight for what you get out of it.
